	/**
	 * A TileSprite is a Sprite that has a repeating texture. The texture can be scrolled and scaled independently of the TileSprite itself.
	 * Textures will automatically wrap and are designed so that you can create game backdrops using seamless textures as a source.
	 * 
	 * TileSprites have no input handler or physics bodies by default, both need enabling in the same way as for normal Sprites.
	 * 
	 * You shouldn't ever create a TileSprite any larger than your actual screen size. If you want to create a large repeating background
	 * that scrolls across the whole map of your game, then you create a TileSprite that fits the screen size and then use the tilePosition
	 * property to scroll the texture as the player moves. If you create a TileSprite that is thousands of pixels in size then it will 
	 * consume huge amounts of memory and cause performance issues. Remember: use tilePosition to scroll your texture and tileScale to
	 * adjust the scale of the texture - don't resize the sprite itself or make it larger than it needs.
	 * 
	 * An important note about texture dimensions:
	 * 
	 * When running under Canvas a TileSprite can use any texture size without issue. When running under WebGL the texture should ideally be
	 * a power of two in size (i.e. 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, etch pixels width by height). If the texture isn't a power of two
	 * it will be rendered to a blank canvas that is the correct size, which means you may have 'blank' areas appearing to the right and
	 * bottom of your frame. To avoid this ensure your textures are perfect powers of two.
	 * 
	 * TileSprites support animations in the same way that Sprites do. You add and play animations using the AnimationManager. However
	 * if your game is running under WebGL please note that each frame of the animation must be a power of two in size, or it will receive
	 * additional padding to enforce it to be so.
